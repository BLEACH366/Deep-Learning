# P2DFlow

P2DFlow is a protein ensemble generative model with SE(3) flow matching based on ESMFold, the ensembles generated by P2DFlow could aid in understanding protein functions across various scenarios.

Technical details and thorough benchmarking results can be found in our paper:

## Installation
In an environment with cuda 11.7, run:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
To activate the environment, run:
```
conda activate P2DFlow
```

## Prepare Dataset
* Coming soon!


## Model weights
Download the pretrained checkpoint from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11mdVfMi2rpVn7nNG2mQAGA5sNXCKePZj?usp=sharing) whose filename is `pretrained.ckpt`, and put it into `./weights` folder.


## Training
To train P2DFlow, firstly make sure you have prepare the dataset according to `Prepare Dataset` and put it in the right folder, then modify the config file in `./configs/base.yaml`(especially for `csv_path` and `energy_csv_path` ). After this, you can run:
```
python -u experiments/train_se3_flows.py
```
And you will get the checkpoints in `./ckpt`


## Inference
To infer for specified protein sequence, firstly modify the input .csv file in `./inference/valid_seq.csv` and config file in `./configs/inference.yaml`(especially for `validset_path`), then run:
```
python -u experiments/inference_se3_flows.py
```
And you will get the results in `./inference_outputs/weights/`


## Evaluation
* Coming soon!
